# Clonger

## Description

A tool for designing conlangs

## Features

The general idea is drawn out in the file [Conlang Creation Tool Design.pdf](./docs/Conlang Creation Tool Design.pdf)

Essentially, there's
 - an area that allows you to type IPA symbols easily and then copy them into various areas
 - an area that allows you to document your language's grammar and stuff in a formatted way using italics, bold, underline, tables, and images
 - an area that allows you to provide examples of your language
 - an area that acts as a dictionary

## Building

NOTE: Linux users need to first install `libc6-dev`
